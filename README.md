# CaesarCracker
Reading through "Learn Java the Easy Way" and an example program came up to convert strings into caesar cipher. I thought that was boring so I made this instead.

# Usage
To decode any message in caesar cipher with any key, just put the message in and scrub through the slider until you find a decoded message.
You can also use this to encode a message. Put in your message and scroll until you find an encrypted message you like. You can copy the finished message by dragging over it and CTRL+C. Give your friend the key and they can use the inverse to decode it later.
